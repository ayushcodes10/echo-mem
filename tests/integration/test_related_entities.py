"""A write should say what the graph already calls this.

Measured on the author's store, 2026-09-13: 246 entities in the shared scope,
median degree 1, and 147 of them (60%) appearing in exactly one fact. Each
episode arrives with its own new names, makes two nodes, joins them to each
other and stops. Nothing ever tells the writing agent that the graph already
has a word for what it is describing.

That is the reason multi-hop retrieval cannot be built yet: a traversal across
a median-degree-1 graph leaves a leaf, reaches a project hub and stops. No work
on the read path fixes a graph with nothing to walk.

These pin the three properties that make the nudge worth returning at all: it
finds an entity a related fact already uses, it does not suggest connections
that already exist, and it never changes what was written.
