"""Structured server-side logging: one JSON object per line to STDERR, no
raw fact/entity text (see log_write_episode's summary-only fields), so logs
are safe to ship off-box without also shipping user memory content.

Stderr, not stdout, and that is load-bearing rather than a style choice: the
MCP server speaks its protocol over stdout, so a log line written there would
be framed as a protocol message and corrupt the stream.

Fields may be passed either way. `extra={"fields": {...}}` is the original
shape; `extra={"k": v}` is the idiom Python's logging docs teach, and every
call site that reached for it was silently dropping every field it passed,
because the formatter only ever read `record.fields`. Both now work."""
