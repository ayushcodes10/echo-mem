"""Which project a fact was written from.

Resolved server-side from the process's working directory, never passed in by
the calling agent. Same reasoning as group_id (see the design doc's
Configuration section): a value an agent types is a value an agent types
inconsistently, and "eigen" / "Eigon" / "eigen-backend" across three calls
would make the project dimension worthless for exactly the grouping it exists
to provide.

This works because each session gets its own MCP server process whose cwd is
the project directory - verified against four live processes, three in
work/dugout and one in work/echo-mem. So no per-project registration, env var
or config file is needed for the common case.

ECHO_MEMORY_PROJECT overrides, for callers where cwd means nothing: the direct
Python client embedded in a long-running service (see docs/INTEGRATIONS.md), a
container whose cwd is /app, or a chatbot serving many tenants from one
process."""
