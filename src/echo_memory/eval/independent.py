"""An evaluation whose questions were not written from its answers.

`eval/retrieval.py` builds a query out of the fact it wants back. That makes
labels free, and it is why every number it produces describes the generated
task rather than retrieval. Two review rounds established the stronger version
of that limitation: a biased task can change WHICH CONFIGURATION WINS, not only
the level of both, so the harness cannot settle what should ship. The recorded
sign reversal - dropping the lexical channel measured +0.120 MRR under one
query shape and -0.088 under another - is an instance.

This is the other half. The independence that matters is from the gold-answer
construction and from the tuning, and it is enforced by order and by shape:

  1. A question is written and stored BEFORE anything is retrieved for it. It
     cannot have been fitted to a result that did not exist yet.
  2. The retriever is frozen at a commit, recorded on the question and again on
     every run. A question and a score from different code are two
     measurements.
  3. Every configuration runs, and their results are POOLED and shuffled. The
     judge sees a question and a list of facts, never a configuration.
  4. Relevance is judged for a (question, fact) pair. One label serves every
     configuration, and any number of facts may be relevant - which is what
     the old harness could not express, since it marked exactly one fact
     correct for a name that may appear in thirty.

**Pooling bias is not solved by any of this.** A fact no configuration
returned is never judged, so recall here is recall over the pooled relevant
set, never over the store. Reported as such, everywhere it appears.

The author may write the questions. Independence from the author is not what
was ever at stake - a person who knows the subject matter is the only person
who can ask a real question about it - and demanding it would make the
evaluation impossible rather than sound. What must not happen is a question
shaped by an answer, a score compared across code versions, or a judge who
knows which system produced a candidate. Those are the three this prevents.
