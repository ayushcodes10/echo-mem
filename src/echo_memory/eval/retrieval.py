"""Does a retrieval change actually help? Measure it.

Every tuning decision in this project so far has been argued rather than
demonstrated. `COSINE_FLOOR` was picked, then measured a year of usage later to
be sitting inside the noise. `k=60` and `LIST_DEPTH=50` were written down as
"low-leverage" when in fact the fusion had never had two lists to fuse. The
common cause is that there was no way to tell whether a change was an
improvement, so nobody could be wrong out loud.

**The labels are free.** A fact is an edge between two named entities, and the
question an agent actually asks is entity-shaped - "what do I know about
updateSquad" - so the entity names make a query and the fact they connect is
the gold answer. That is not circular: the query is two short labels, the gold
is a sentence of prose that shares only some of their words, and the ranker has
to find it among every other fact in the store.

It is also not a benchmark. It measures one store against itself, so the
absolute numbers mean nothing outside it. What it is for is A/B: run two
configurations over the same cases and see which retrieves better, which is the
question that was previously unanswerable.

Three metrics, and the second two matter more than the first.

  recall@k   did the gold fact come back at all
  MRR        how high, averaged - moving a hit from rank 8 to rank 2 shows here
             and is invisible to recall@10
  tokens     what the answer cost. A configuration that finds everything by
             returning everything is not better, and this is the number that
             says so.

**One metric cannot judge every change.** Each case has a single right answer,
so this measures ranking and nothing else. MMR was added for diversity among
the returned facts, which a single-answer metric is blind to by construction:
the tables show it costs ranking on every shape, which is why it is off, and
they say nothing about whether it delivered the diversity it was added for.
Read a removal here as "it costs ranking", never as "it does nothing".

**Query shape decides the answer, so it is not a detail.** The first version of
this harness asked every question as "<source> <target>". Once entity names
were embedded into each fact, that query became a literal substring of the text
it was scoring against - maximum leakage - and it inverted a real conclusion:
under it, dropping the lexical channel measured +0.112 MRR and looked like a
significant win. On queries with the entity names removed the same change is
-0.082, significantly WORSE. One default query shape produced two opposite
answers about the same code.

So shapes are plural and named, and the leaky one is labelled:

  entity_pair   both names. Maximum leakage now that names are embedded. Kept
                because it is the entity-centric lookup an agent really does
                make, but never read alone.
  entity_single one name. The realistic middle - a question usually names one
                of the things it is about, and half the prepended string.
  prose         the fact's own words with both entity names stripped. No
                overlap with what was prepended, so nothing can leak; also the
                least realistic, since nobody queries in the target's prose.

**And MRR is a mean, so it has a standard error.** At n=219 with sd ~0.35 the
SE is ~0.023, which makes any difference under ~0.047 indistinguishable from
zero. Differences of 0.001 to 0.01 were reported as findings before this was
computed. Every comparison now carries a paired bootstrap interval, and
`compare` says plainly when a difference is noise.
