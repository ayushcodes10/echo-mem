"""What this episode should probably have connected to.

The store this was built in has 246 entities in its shared scope and a median
degree of 1: 147 of them (60%) appear in exactly one fact. The shape is a
handful of project hubs carrying 14 to 35 edges and a long tail of leaves that
each turn up once and are never mentioned again. The solo scope is the same,
63% at degree <= 1.

That is a write-time outcome, not a retrieval one. Every episode arrives with
its own freshly invented names, gets two new nodes, joins them to each other,
and stops. Nothing in the write path ever tells the agent that the graph
already has a word for what it is describing, so nothing pulls successive
episodes onto shared vocabulary.

It matters because multi-hop retrieval - the next version's whole argument - is
a traversal, and a traversal across a median-degree-1 graph leaves a leaf,
reaches its project hub and stops. The premise of the next phase is not
supported by the data this phase produces, and no amount of work on the read
path fixes that.

So: after an episode is written, find the facts already in the scope that are
nearest to what was just written, and name the entities they connect.

**Similarity between fact texts, not between names.** Entity resolution scores
name against name and was calibrated on this store at AUC 0.666, 95% CI
[0.421, 0.881] - an interval containing chance. Fact-text retrieval on the same
store measures R@1 0.949 and MRR 0.970 on the prose query shape. One of those
two signals is worth building on. This rides the one that works.

**Advisory, and only advisory.** The episode is already committed when this
runs. It cannot block a write, change a resolution, or add an edge. Inventing a
connection nobody asserted would be worse than the sparsity it is trying to
fix: a memory graph is only worth reading if every edge in it was claimed by
somebody.
